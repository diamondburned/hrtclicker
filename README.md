This service was written because this one was struggling to keep track of when to apply its estrogen patches,
so it built a service to keep track of that for it. Being a pure Go service that relies on [Gotify][gotify]
to send out push notifications to its phone, no Java code was needed.

[gotify]: https://gotify.net

## Architecture

- Web frontend that allows recording HRT history and displaying statistics
- Configuration:
    - Recommended time intervals for HRT
- Gotify integration: push notifications when it's time to do HRT
